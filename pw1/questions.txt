Did you observe any differences when changing the order of the lines manipulating the transformations?

No, we did not observe any differences when changing the order of the lines manipulating the transformations. 
This is because, in Three.js, each object's local transformation matrix is automatically updated from its position, rotation and scale properties in a fixed order: M = T * R * S (translation * rotation * scale).
Differences would only appear if we disabled this behavior by setting the matrixAutoUpdate property to false and manually updated the transformation matrix ourselves, where the multiplication order would then matter.
